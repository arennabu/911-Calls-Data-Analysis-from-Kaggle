# 911-Calls-Data-Analysis-from-Kaggle

# Introduction and key findings

This dataset from Kaggle contains calls to 911 (emergency calls) in Montgomery Country Pennsylvania. I looked closely into the frequency of 911 calls that happened in different days of week, months, zipcodes, for different reasons. 

Here are some key findings: 
- EMS related 911 calls had the highest frequency in every month 
- There were more 911 calls on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
- January, followed by July, was the months that received the highest numbers of 911 calls
